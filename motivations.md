I've reached a point in my life where coasting through it is no longer tenable. I wrote in my journal the other night how Mod0 alone has made me feel like I am once more in the driver's seat of my life, taking control of its direction and course instead of riding along to an inevitable fate...I desperately needed that change, mentally and spiritually speaking. Thus far, programing has met or exceeded every one of my expectations/wildest dreams for intellectual stimulation, challenges, and above all else: fun!
